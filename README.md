## Rogue-Like first person game with the goal to collect enough treasure to retire.

Players explore a procedurally generated maze-like dungeon that procedurally generates loot and spawns monsters at random points.

Once the player collects enough loot to complete the game, they must retrace their steps out of the dungeon again, remembering which directions they took.

Permadeath rules, horror and tense atmosphere.

Inspiration: Darkest Dungeon
