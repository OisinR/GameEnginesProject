## Audio responsive music visualiser

### Description
This is a music visualisation project made in Unity. The visualiser works by takeing data from a currently playing piece of audio and analyses it through a script. Other scripts then hook into that script and use the values it finds to scale and rotate objects in the scene. The visualiser also uses the bloom post processing effect and has a lot of flashing lights/colours.

The audio track used for this project is a cover of e1m9 from doom, performed by sonicclang.

###  Parts from myself vs parts that came from class or tutorials
I used both the class scripts and this playlist as inspiration and help for the project. In particular, the AudioAnalyser script.

For the spheres I got some help for the maths off of the Unity forums, everything else inlcuding scene composition is my own.
### Most proud of
I find the way that everything in the scene is rotating in different directions with so much happening at once to be quite hypnotic. My favourite part of the visualiser is in the middle (2:11 in the youtube video) where all the close cubes in the spheres 
die down and the ones at the back kind of twinkle like stars.

### Instructions for building/running
